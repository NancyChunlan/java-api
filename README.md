# OSS Index java-api

GitHub: https://github.com/OSSIndex/java-api

Version 2.0 of this class is a complete rewrite to work with the OSS Index v2.0 API.
It is a greatly simplified, minimalist implementation. As required it will be expanded
to cover more of the API.

If you have parts of the API you would like covered, or have feature requests, please
let us know and we will add them.
