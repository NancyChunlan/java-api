/** Representation of a Vulnerability, backed by the OSS Index REST API.
 * 
 * Vulnerabilities come in 3 flavours
 * 
 *   1. As a search result -- external link (/v1.0/scm/299024085/vulnerabilities).
 *      An 'external link' vulnerability is a vulnerability that has been added,
 *      likely manually, which is comprised simply of a link to an external site
 *      describing a vulnerability, and the versions affected. The versions are
 *      related to the unique SCM/artifact that references this vulnerability
 *      instance. Note that a vulnerability *may* affect multiple products, but
 *      the version field is related to the SCM/Aftifact being queries for.
 *       [
 *         {
 *           "uri": "https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/uglifyjs_incorrectly_handles_non-boolean_comparisons",
 *           "versions": [
 *             "<= 2.4.23"
 *           ]
 *          }
 *       ]
 *       
 *   2. As a search result -- CVE (/v1.0/scm/296375846/vulnerabilities).
 *      These are vulnerabilities found in the National Vulnerability Database(NVD).
 *      The versions are
 *      related to the unique SCM/artifact that references this vulnerability
 *      instance. Note that a vulnerability *may* affect multiple products, but
 *      the version field is related to the SCM/Aftifact being queries for.
 *      
 *       [
 *         {
 *          "uri": "cve:/CVE-2011-4969",
 *          "id": "348528",
 *          "cve-id": "CVE-2011-4969",
 *          "summary": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jQuery before 1.6.3, when using location.hash to select elements, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted tag.",
 *          "details": "http://localhost:8080/v1.0/cve/348528",
 *          "versions": [
 *            "1.6",
 *            "1.6.1",
 *            "1.6.2"
 *          ]
 *        },
 *        ...
 *       ]
 *
 *   3. Full CVE details (/v1.0/cve/323345)
 *      Note that in this case there is no version field in the same sense as the
 *      ones as a result of search, since when searching there is a single product
 *      for which we are returning versions, whereas when CVE details are retrieved
 *      they may be affecting multiple versions.
